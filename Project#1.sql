                 wines: IDs, color, wine Age, wine name, vine age, Grape blend, Amount made

                 Member: IDs, first name, last name, email, birthday, payment
                 companies: IDs, name
                 location: IDs, zip, street
                 
				 , while also keeping track of the TABLE connecting each of the TABLE listed 
				 above.  This data base is keeping records of each TABLE inner contents 
                 (stuff procceding a colon).
                 Connecting each table =
                 
                 wineries_wine

                 wines_Tasting_Room
                 Tasting_Room_Member: Member?
                 companies_location
                 
				  NOTE: wineries_wine & wineries_Tasting_Room TABLE are backup TABLE in case the relatiON to 
						wineries, wines, or Tasting_Rooms become comprimised in some way.  These are just
						in case TABLE so the REFERENCES and the FOREIGN KEYS can be stored if a glitch
						or unforeseen circumstance were to occur and comprimise the connectiON between each table.
